FAQ:

####_tkinter.TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable

Go to Edit Configurations... and set user environment variable to DISPLAY:0. You will also need to set up the display, which could include running xMing. More research is needed on alternatives which apparently include running in MS-DOS
